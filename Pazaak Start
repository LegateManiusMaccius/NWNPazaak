Sequence:
1. 4 random cards are selected of the 10 placed inside the player and the NPC's "Pazaak Bag"
2. The script uses RNG to select who goes first.
3. The first player is dealt a card
4. 1st player chooses 1 of 5 options 1) End turn 2) Stand 3) Choose a card 4) Increase Bet 5)Fold
5. 2nd player is dealt a card.
6. 2nd player chooses 1 of 5 options 1) End turn 2) Stand 3) Choose a card 4) Increase Bet 5)Fold
7. This process repeats until both players stand/bust.

This is the initial code that starts the game of Pazaak, initializes the deck, ensures that the tables are clear, resets the pot, clears
the scores and sets the PCSpeaker as "Playing".
