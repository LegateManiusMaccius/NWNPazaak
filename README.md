Bringing Pazaak to the NWN game!
Pazzak!
*The idea is to create the codes for the game to be held within a conversation much like how it is possible to do the same with a game
of blackjack or 5 card draw.
*Cards that are bought by the player. We use the test for item "card tag" for the specific cards that the player has bought.
*We assing the card values based on the tag and then use RNG to pick 4 of the cards the player has.
*The NPC will have a set cards in their inventory allowing us to use the same method to change the hands of all the NPCs.
*Once this is done we have the main deck which is 40 cards 1-10 with 4 copies of each. we assign each the number and then RNG to deal the
cards. the cards add to the overall number. after each player is dealt a card they have the opportunity to add one of the cards in their 
hand of 4 to the overall number. Those that have two possibilities +/- 3/6 are able to be scripted in as 2 options in a conversation and
removed if either choice is taken. The betting the n takes place. Then the NPC gets a turn and can use the appropriate cards or pass.
Repeat process until the had is over.
